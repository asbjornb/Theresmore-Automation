# Theresmore Automation

Quality of life helper for the [Theresmore](https://www.theresmoregame.com/play/) game.

## âœ¨ Assist Mode (Recommended)

**Passive building assistant that respects your gameplay decisions.**

Assist Mode is a gentle helper that only acts when you're idle and resources are going to waste. It's designed to assist your manual play, not replace it.

### How It Works

1. **Waits for Idle**: Only activates after 60 seconds of no player activity
2. **Monitors Resources**: Checks if any resource reaches 90% capacity
3. **Builds Smart**: Selects the **cheapest** building that uses the capped resource
4. **Stays Safe**:
   - Won't build statues or shrines (strategic choices are yours)
   - Won't build Pillars of Mana (negative gold production)
   - Won't build anything that would make food production negative
   - Won't build with Lucky Stones (too valuable)
5. **Minimal Interference**: Builds one building, then waits 30 seconds before checking again

### Usage

1. Enable the "Assist Mode" checkbox in the control panel (top-right of game)
2. Play normally - the script won't interfere while you're active
3. Step away or stop clicking - after 60 seconds, it will prevent resource waste
4. Check browser console (F12) to see what it's doing

**This mode is perfect for playing with friends without feeling like you're "cheating" - you're still making all the strategic decisions!**

## Installation

Install an extension that supports Userscripts, like [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

Then simply open
[https://github.com/Theresmore-Automation/Theresmore-Automation/releases/latest/download/bundle.user.js](https://github.com/Theresmore-Automation/Theresmore-Automation/releases/latest/download/bundle.user.js)
to have the script installed.

## Development

Start by installing dependencies with `npm install`.

### Bundle

Bundle everything from `src/` into `dist/bundle.user.js`:

`npm run build`

### Development server

`npm run serve`

This will automatically update `dist/bundle.user.js` when code changes and serve it on [localhost:8124](http://localhost:8124/).

It also creates a second userscript `dist/dev.user.js`, if you install it in Tampermonkey, it will automatically fetch the latest version from
http://localhost:8124/bundle.user.js once you reload a website with F5.

### Bundle without source map

Bundle for publishing without sourcemapping to `dist/release-3.2.1.user.js`

`npm run build:release`

or on Windows

`npm run build:release:win32`

## Other

- Template based on [rollup-userscript-template](https://github.com/cvzi/rollup-userscript-template)
- Options are imported/exported using [LZString](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string)

## Advanced Automation (Optional)

**Note**: The script includes more aggressive automation features that are disabled by default. These are accessible via the "Manage Options" button but are
intended for power users who want full automation.

For most players, we recommend sticking with **Assist Mode** for a more balanced experience.

### Advanced Features Include

- Full building automation with priority systems
- Automatic population management
- Marketplace trading automation
- Army recruitment, scouting, and combat
- Research automation
- Prestige and New Game+ automation

### Usage Tips (Advanced Mode)

- Each section is independently enabled/disabled
- It is generally safe to enable all production/buildings. You may want to select the mutually exclusive buildings (like `Statue of Atamar/Firio/Lurezia` or
  `Harvest/War/Mind Shrine`) by hand, and limit how many `Pillars of Mana` you want built
- The `Marketplace` can help overcome some gold problems. Be sure to tweak the numbers to match your production speed, allowing enough time for the prices to
  return to normal. Try starting with limited amount of resources to sell (like `Cows`) until you feel comfortable to enable others
- The `Population` tab can help auto-assign workers. Take note of `Minimum food` toggle at bottom
- When you're ready for some action, you can automate army production, scouting, and fighting in the `Army` tab
